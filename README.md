**_Rating system for CrossFit competitions._**

The system knows how to handle different types of events - the highest number of reps, the shortest time and the highest weight,
and also knows how to use tiebreakers.
The system reads data from Ecxel file, and writes into it the score of the current event, and the total score of the competition.

Attached an Excel file for example and the system jar file.

This version is suitable for a teens competition held in May 2019 at CROSSFIT REL*
